1. 
git branch:
- shows your branches and star * says your on that branch.
- ex. * master


2. 
    git checkout -branch (name of the branch):
- ex. git checkout -b feature-readme-instructions

3. git checkout (name of that branch) => for switching between branches.

4. git merge   --- but before we can use git diff

5. delete branch: 
git branch -d (name of the branch)    

6. add and commit simultaneously only for modified files not added ones.

7. some commands for undoing things in git:

    - to cancel add => git reset or git reset (name of the file)
    - to cancel commit => git reset HEAD~1 (BEFORE LAST COMMIT).

    example: 


    FIRST I CHECKED THE STATUS:
            PS C:\Users\Alire\OneDrive\Desktop\fromLocalToRemote> git status 
    On branch main
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

    Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
            modified:   gitBranch.txt

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")


    2. THEN I ADDED THE FILE:


    PS C:\Users\Alire\OneDrive\Desktop\fromLocalToRemote> git add gitBranches.txt
    fatal: pathspec 'gitBranches.txt' did not match any files
    PS C:\Users\Alire\OneDrive\Desktop\fromLocalToRemote> git add gitBranch.txt
    PS C:\Users\Alire\OneDrive\Desktop\fromLocalToRemote> git status
    On branch main
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

    Changes to be committed:
    (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
            modified:   gitBranch.txt



    3. THEN I RESETED THE FILE MODIFICATION:        

    PS C:\Users\Alire\OneDrive\Desktop\fromLocalToRemote> git reset
    Unstaged changes after reset:
    M       gitBranch.txt
    PS C:\Users\Alire\OneDrive\Desktop\fromLocalToRemote> git status
    On branch main
    Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

    Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
            modified:   gitBranch.txt

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
    PS C:\Users\Alire\OneDrive\Desktop\fromLocalToRemote>

    SO NOW THE FILE HAS YET TO BE COMMITTED.

8. to change or delete a specific commit:
use => git log
